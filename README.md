// M6 Knowledge Check //

This code creates a simple web application that allows users to search for a Pokemon by either its name or ID. Upon submission, it fetches 
data from the PokeAPI and displays the Pokemon's name, image, ID, and type. If the user provides no input or an invalid query, the application 
shows an appropriate error message.
